## 📖 Overview

**Agri OS** is not just an app; it's a comprehensive **Digital Ecosystem** designed to revolutionize agriculture. By integrating **Real-Time Data**, **AI Diagnostics**, and **Direct Market Access**, Agri OS empowers farmers to make informed decisions, reduce crop loss, and maximize profits.

We are building the **Operating System for Agriculture**—simple enough for a novice, yet powerful enough for an expert.
